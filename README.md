# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-

I worked on a project called** Pizza Sales Analysis**, where I created a relational database system to analyze the sales and performance of different pizzas.
The goal was to gain insights into sales trends, popular pizzas, and revenue generation using SQL queries.

This allowed me to apply my SQL skills to create a database, populate it with sample data, and query it to answer meaningful business questions.

I designed a database with four key tables:



**Pizza**: Contains details like pizza ID, type, size, and price.

**PizzaType**: Includes information about each pizza type, such as name, ingredients, and category.

**Orders**: Tracks order IDs, pizza IDs, order dates, and times.

**OrderDetails**: Contains details of each order, including quantities of pizzas ordered.

These tables are interconnected through primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and avoiding redundancy.
